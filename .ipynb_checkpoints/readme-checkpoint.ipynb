    "## Introduction\n",
    "This repository contains the codes, datasets, and pre-trained models used for \"Message propagation through time: A training algorithm to retain sample dependency\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series modeling, a crucial area in science, often encounters challenges when training ML models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using the conventional mini-batch training strategy that assumes independent and identically distributed (IID) samples and initializes RNNs with zero hidden states. The IID assumption ignores temporal dependencies among samples, resulting in poor performance. Stateful training strategies have been proposed to leverage hidden states to maintain relationships between samples. However, they are slow, and their rigid mini-batch structures can lead to unstable training. Other approaches, inspired by dynamical control theory, adaptively estimate responses from RNNs as the system conditions to maintain sample relationships. However, these approaches may struggle when responses encode limited temporal information and are prone to error accumulation during inference. This paper proposes Message Propagation Through Time (MPTT) algorithm to effectively incorporates long temporal dependencies while preserving fast training times like random mini-batch training. MPTT utilizes two memory modules to asynchronously manage informative initial hidden states for RNNs, fostering seamless information exchange between samples and allowing diverse mini-batches for stable training. MPTT further implements three policies to filter outdated and preserve essential information in the hidden states throughout training to generate informative initial hidden states for RNNs, facilitating more robust training compared to stateful RNNs and response-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that MPTT outperforms seven baselines on four climate datasets with varying levels of temporal dependencies.\n",

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "We provide an 'environment.yml' file to aid in setting up the necessary Conda environment for running our experiments. Please follow these steps to prepare your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Conda by following the instructions in the [Conda User Guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).\n",
    "2. Create the Conda environment using our provided 'environment.yml' file. For detailed instructions, refer to [this section](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) in the Conda User Guide. You can also use the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Once the environment is created, activate it with the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate mptt_exps\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. With the environment activated, you are now ready to run the experiments.\n",
